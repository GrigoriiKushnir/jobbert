Problem statement:
We have many very close synonyms of job titles (similarity > 0.9).
We need to find the best representation of each group of synonyms and remove all other titles from the group.

Approach:

1. Curated dataset
+ c.e.o
+ ceo
+ interim ceo
+ director ceo
+ chief executive officer
- chief elastic officer (similarity 0.75)

Goal:
2. Double curated dataset
Algorithm:
1) Find all pairs that have similarity above threshold (0.9)
2) Create graph using all pairs from 1)
3) Find centroid of graph (title that has highest average distance everyone else in the group)
4) Keep centroid and remove everything else
5) Repeat 1-4 until no more pairs are found

Example:
Assume chief executive officer is the centroid, then it will not eliminated, however all its synonyms will be eliminated.
chief executive officer -> everything else removed


3. Input: ceo
Output: chief executive officer
chief elastic officer -> will not be returned because it's similarity is less than the threshold in the algorithm.
